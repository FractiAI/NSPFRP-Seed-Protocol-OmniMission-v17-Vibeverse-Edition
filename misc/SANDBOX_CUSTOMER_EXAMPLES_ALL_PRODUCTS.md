- Identifies: "Northwest corner has single vent, blocked by equipment"
- Calculates: "Temperature 8°F higher than rest of plant"
- Insight: "Simple HVAC modification will fix 80% of defects"

ANATOMIST DOMAIN analyzes:
- Maps human factors (worker positioning, ergonomics)
- Observes: "Workers in hot area take more breaks, rush work"
- Measures: "Precision drops 22% when uncomfortable"
- Insight: "Human performance degrades in heat"

INVENTOR DOMAIN synthesizes:
- Novel solution: "Smart cooling vests for workers + HVAC fix"
- Combines infrastructure and human-centered design
- Estimates: "95% defect reduction possible"
- Insight: "Two-pronged approach beats single solution"

MATHEMATICIAN DOMAIN calculates:
- Current cost: 15% defects = $1.5M/year waste
- HVAC fix: $50K one-time
- Cooling vests: $5K (10 vests)
- Savings: $1.4M/year
- ROI: 27× return in first year

PHILOSOPHER DOMAIN reflects:
- Root cause: "We focused on outputs (defects) not inputs (environment)"
- Wisdom: "Humans perform naturally when conditions support them"
- Principle: "Fix the garden, not the flowers"
- Insight: "This pattern applies to all systems"

STEP 4: Integrated Solution Emerges
Leonardo System synthesizes all 7 perspectives:

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:
1. HVAC modification (northwest corner cooling)
2. Smart cooling vests for all floor workers
3. Temperature monitoring system
4. Break schedules optimized for heat management
5. Ongoing environmental audits

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
- Defect rate: 15% → 1% (93% reduction)
- Savings: $1.4M/year
- Cost: $55K (one-time)
- Payback: 14 days
- Confidence: 98% (all domains align)

STEP 5: Adjustable Precision Demo
Chen tests precision levels:

LOW PRECISION (10%): "Fix the cooling"
- Fast, general direction
- Might miss nuances

MEDIUM PRECISION (50%): "HVAC + worker comfort"
- Balanced approach
- Good for most situations

HIGH PRECISION (95%): Full 7-domain analysis above
- Surgical accuracy
- Breakthrough insights

Chen sees: "Higher precision = better solutions, worth the compute"

STEP 6: Compare Single Domain vs Leonardo
Single domain (Engineer only):
- Solution: "Fix HVAC"
- Cost: $50K
- Expected reduction: 60% (good but incomplete)

Leonardo (7 domains):
- Solution: HVAC + vests + monitoring + schedules + audits
- Cost: $55K (barely more)
- Expected reduction: 93% (breakthrough)

Difference: 33% better outcome for 10% more cost

STEP 7: Generate Portfolio Entry
- "Manufacturing Breakthrough 2026"
- Shows Chen used Leonardo Polymathic System
- Documents 7-domain analysis process
- 5-star polymathic rating
- Shareable case study

DECISION: Chen purchases Leonardo Professional, applies to all major challenges.

RESULT: Game-changing solutions, company-wide transformation.

SYNTH TEAM for same project:
- 90 SYNTH agents (all included in subscription)
- Subscription: $3,690/year ÷ 12 = $308/month
- Project cost: $308 (1 month)
