## 🌟 THE CORE PRINCIPLE

### To Public: Science Fiction Game

**"To public-facing without awareness, we must always be a really good science fiction game—a new type that really blooms imagination."**

**What This Means:**

✅ **Position as innovative sci-fi game** (accessible, fun, imaginative)  
✅ **Emphasize imagination and creativity** (not technical complexity)  
✅ **Make it feel like playing in a sci-fi universe** (adventure, exploration)  
✅ **Focus on experience, not underlying tech** (what you DO, not how it works)  
✅ **Bloom imagination** (inspire, excite, create wonder)  

❌ **Don't lead with technical protocol details** (overwhelming)  
❌ **Don't require deep awareness of architecture** (barrier to entry)  
❌ **Don't explain NSPFRNP first** (confusing to newcomers)  
❌ **Don't use insider terminology** (alienating)
