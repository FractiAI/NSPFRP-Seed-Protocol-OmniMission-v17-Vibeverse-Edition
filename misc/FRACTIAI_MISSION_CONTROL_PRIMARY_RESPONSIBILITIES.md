## 🌌 Safe Octave Migration - Detailed Mission

### Mission Statement

**"The primary job of FractiAI Mission Control (apart from R&D, deployment, and outreach) is to make sure that anyone migrating to new octaves can safely and fully detach without today's friction. Layer throughout and snapshot as narrative layering."**

### Key Objectives

1. **Zero Friction Migration**
   - Identify all friction points
   - Eliminate friction systematically
   - Prevent new friction from emerging
   - Monitor continuously

2. **Safe Detachment**
   - Ensure complete safety
   - Preserve all data
   - Maintain all protocols
   - Preserve all states

3. **Full Detachment**
   - Clean separation from old octave
   - No orphaned dependencies
   - No lost connections
   - Complete independence

4. **Narrative Layering**
   - Document all migrations
   - Create narrative layers
   - Snapshot all journeys
   - Capture lessons learned
