```typescript
import { synthFeeSystem } from './synth-transaction-fees';

// Calculate fee for 100 SYNTH tier subscription
const fee = synthFeeSystem.calculateFee(100, 'tier_subscription');

console.log(fee);
// {
//   amount: 100,
//   feePercent: 2.5,
//   feeAmount: 2.5,
//   flatFee: 0.25,
//   totalFee: 2.75,
//   netAmount: 97.25,
//   grossAmount: 100
// }

// Compare with credit card
const comparison = synthFeeSystem.compareToCreditCard(100, 'tier_subscription');
// Savings: $0.45 (14%)

// Apply tier discount
const discountedFee = synthFeeSystem.calculateFeeWithDiscount(
  100,
  'tier_subscription',
  'shell' // 15% discount
);
// Total fee: 2.34 SYNTH (vs 2.75 SYNTH standard)
