## 💡 WHY THIS DISTINCTION MATTERS

### The Strategic Design

```yaml
VISITOR (Sandbox):
├─ Zero friction entry
├─ No commitment required
├─ Explore forever (no pressure)
├─ Learn system completely
├─ Decide when ready
└─ Convert naturally (when they see value)

GUEST (First Purchase):
├─ Test with real product
├─ Experience actual delivery
├─ Generate real SYNTH
├─ See membership benefits
├─ Compare value (product vs membership)
└─ Upgrade when it makes sense

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
├─ Visitor: No risk exploration
├─ Guest: Low commitment trial
├─ Member: Full commitment
├─ Each tier = Natural progression
└─ No pressure at any level
```

---

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION

### How It Works in Code

```typescript
enum MembershipTier {
  VISITOR = 0,       // Sandbox/no charge
  GUEST = 1,         // First purchase (not membership)
  MEMBERS_ONLY = 2,  // Full membership
  BACKSTAGE_PASS = 3,
  ULTIMATE_VIP = 4
}

// Conversion logic
function onFirstPurchase(userId: string, productId: string): void {
  // User was VISITOR (tier 0)
  // Now becomes GUEST (tier 1)
  
  if (isMembershipPurchase(productId)) {
    // Direct to MEMBERS_ONLY (tier 2)
    upgradeTier(userId, MembershipTier.MEMBERS_ONLY);
  } else {
    // Convert to GUEST (tier 1)
    upgradeTier(userId, MembershipTier.GUEST);
  }
}

function isMembershipPurchase(productId: string): boolean {
  // Check if purchase is a membership
  // vs a single product
  return productId.includes('membership');
}
```
