## 🎮 THE GAME EXPLAINED

### Core Mechanics

**90 Trillion Notes Available**
- Start at $1 per note (Day 1 = TODAY)
- Price increases $1 every single day
- Day 2 = $2, Day 7 = $7, Day 30 = $30, etc.
- Once 90T notes are claimed, vault closes forever

**50 Trillion Nodes Activating**
- Each note activates 1 node (up to 50T total)
- Nodes provide coordination capacity
- Network intelligence emerges naturally
- Value compounds with adoption

**NFT Trading Cards for Everything**
- vCHIPs → Trading Card NFTs
- Awareness Keys → Trading Card NFTs
- VibeCraft → Trading Card NFTs
- Properties → Trading Card NFTs
- Businesses → Trading Card NFTs
- Objects → Trading Card NFTs
- Gold Rush Notes → Trading Card NFTs

**Auto-Generated Portfolio Magazine**
- Wallet automatically receives portfolio
- Beautiful 4-star magazine layout
- Auto-organizes by category
- Auto-expands for new types
- Shows total value, rarity, stats
- Shareable on social media

**4-Star Rarity System**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Legendary (Day 1 only!)
- ⭐⭐⭐ Rare (Days 2-7)
- ⭐⭐ Uncommon (Days 8-30)
- ⭐ Common (Day 31+)

### Why This Is a "Gold Rush"

**Time-Based Scarcity**:
- Every day you wait costs $1 more
- Day 1 buyers pay $1, Day 100 buyers pay $100
- Your Day 1 notes become more valuable as price rises
- Early adopters get exponentially better deal

**Supply Cap**:
- Only 90 Trillion notes ever
- No more will be created
- Once gone, vault closes forever
- True scarcity, no inflation

**Network Value**:
- Each note = 1 node of coordination capacity
- More nodes = more network intelligence
- Network effects compound
- Early participants benefit most
