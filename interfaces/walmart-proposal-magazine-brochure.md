# WALMART

## Customer Experience → SYNTH Agent Solution

**From Broken Experience to $7.69B Opportunity**

---

# The Customer Experience

## What Actually Happened

### ❌ The Broken Experience

**Staff Knowledge Gap:** "Do we sell Apple products?" Staff didn't know basic inventory.

**Display vs Stock:** Chose 3 computers from displays - NONE in stock. Staff couldn't tell what was available.

**Security Theater:** Forced to walk out with expensive electronics in transparent bags, felt unsafe.

**Product Inadequacy:** Chromebook worthless for intended purpose. Must return, but now without boxes due to policy conflict.

### The Real Problem

- Staff don't know inventory
- Can't tell what's in stock
- Security policies create unsafe situations
- Return policies conflict with unboxing
- Product quality inadequate
- Customer experience broken at every touchpoint

### Why It Matters

This experience represents THOUSANDS of similar experiences daily. Each bad experience = Lost customer + Lost referrals. Walmart's brand: "Low prices" but also "Bad experience". Competitors (Amazon, Apple Store, Best Buy) don't have this problem.
