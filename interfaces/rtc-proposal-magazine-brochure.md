# RTC RENO

## Seamless Transportation Platform

**From Payment Friction to Free, Seamless Public Transit**

---

# The Customer Experience

## First Sideline Bus Ride

### ❌ Payment Friction Discovered

**No Credit Cards:** Bus doesn't accept credit cards. Only cash or complex scan code.

**Scan Code Confusion:** Multi-step process unclear. Driver: "You have to hit this and then select token and then..." Multiple failed attempts.

**Apple Pay Issues:** Too many failed attempts triggered password reset. Account lockout loop. This happened 4 times already.

**Terminal Confusion:** Terminal building unclear. Each door different purpose. No visible payment window. Had to go to Walmart for cash.

### The Real Problem

- Payment method limitations
- Complex scan code system
- Account lockout loops
- Terminal confusion
- User experience friction
- Accessibility issues

### Why It Matters

Payment friction = barrier to adoption. Complex systems = fewer repeat riders. Confusion = negative word of mouth. Each friction point = lost potential riders. RTC's brand: "Public service" but also "Friction-filled".
