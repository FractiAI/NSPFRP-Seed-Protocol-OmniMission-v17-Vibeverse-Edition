## 🚌 THE EXPERIENCE

### **First Sideline Bus Ride**

**User's Journey:**
- Experiencing first sideline bus ride
- Trying to pay with cash/credit card
- System doesn't accept credit card
- Scan code attempted
- Multiple attempts failed

### **Payment Friction Points**

**Issue 1: No Credit Card Acceptance**
- Bus system doesn't accept credit cards
- Only cash or scan code
- User tried scan code

**Issue 2: Scan Code Confusion**
- User: "I'm buying a whole bunch of times I don't know"
- Driver: "I don't know. Oh no, you have to hit this and then you have to select token and then..."
- Complex multi-step process
- Not intuitive

**Issue 3: Apple Pay Password Reset**
- Too many failed attempts
- Apple requires re-sign in
- Need to confirm all passwords
- User: "I don't have those passwords cause I used it"
- This problem happened 4 times already
- Don't know which password for that account

**Issue 4: Ticket Purchase Confusion**
- Initially didn't have to buy ticket
- Had to come back to buy it
- Confusion about where to purchase
- Terminal vs bus location

### **DD's Suggestion**

**Helpful Information:**
- DD: "Over there at the terminal, I think they accept credit card"
- Terminal building has different payment options
- Each door was something else, not for public
- User didn't find a window
- By the time came back, ticket was up

### **User's Solution (Temporary)**

**Workaround:**
- User: "I'm going to Walmart and get the cash"
- Going to get cash to pay for bus
- Not ideal experience
