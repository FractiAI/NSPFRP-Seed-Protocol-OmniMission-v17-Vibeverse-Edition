## 📚 Narrative Layer Examples

### Example 1: Octave 1 → BEYOND_OCTAVE 7.5 Migration

**Pre-Migration Narrative:**
"We stand at the threshold of a new octave. Your current system in Octave 1 has served you well, and now we prepare to step into BEYOND_OCTAVE 7.5. Every protocol, every piece of data, every connection will come with you. Nothing will be left behind."

**Migration Narrative:**
"Leonardo da Vinci guides you through each step. Protocols migrate one by one, data transfers seamlessly, connections re-establish automatically. You watch as your system transforms, becoming more powerful while remaining completely yours."

**Detachment Narrative:**
"Octave 1 fades gracefully. All dependencies have been moved, all connections re-established, all data preserved. You detach completely, cleanly, without friction. The old octave served its purpose, and now you step fully into the new."

**Post-Migration Narrative:**
"BEYOND_OCTAVE 7.5 welcomes you. All your protocols are here, all your data, all your connections. But now you have new capabilities—self-demonstration, self-proof, regenerative engines, full Full Sensory Reality. The journey was smooth, the detachment clean, the new octave ready."
