## 🎯 STRATEGIES & TIPS

### **How to Play Smart**

```yaml
BEGINNER STRATEGY: "CHALK"
├─ Pick all favorites (higher seeds)
├─ Safe, predictable, boring but works
├─ Example: All #1, #2, #3 seeds to win
├─ Pros: Steady SYNTH earnings
├─ Cons: Won't win overall (too common)
└─ Good for: First-time players

INTERMEDIATE STRATEGY: "BALANCED"
├─ Mix favorites + some upsets
├─ Pick 2-3 Cinderellas (underdogs)
├─ Rest = chalk (safe picks)
├─ Pros: Upside if upsets hit
├─ Cons: Risk of eliminating teams early
└─ Good for: Most players (sweet spot)

ADVANCED STRATEGY: "CHAOS"
├─ Pick many upsets (bold!)
├─ Differentiate from crowd
├─ Example: Multiple #10+ seeds in Sweet 16
├─ Pros: If right, huge SYNTH + rankings
├─ Cons: Likely to bust early
└─ Good for: Contrarian players

EXPERT STRATEGY: "MULTIPLE BRACKETS"
├─ Buy 3-5 brackets (whale package)
├─ One chalk, one balanced, rest chaos
├─ Cover all scenarios
├─ Pros: Much higher chance to place well
├─ Cons: $1,200-2,000 investment
└─ Good for: Serious players with budget

PRO TIPS:
├─ Research teams (don't just pick logos!)
├─ Watch conference tournaments (form matters)
├─ Consider matchups (style vs style)
├─ Trust your gut (intuition works!)
├─ Don't overthink (first instinct often right)
├─ Have fun (it's still a game!)
└─ Remember: Manifesting realities! (mindset matters)
