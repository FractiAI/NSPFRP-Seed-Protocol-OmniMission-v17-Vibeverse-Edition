## 🎯 **WHAT WE BUILT**

### **1. The 4-Tier Model**

```
🆓 FREE ($0)           → Personal use, full system

## 📊 **PRICING STRATEGY**

### **Revenue Model:**

```yaml
FREE Tier:
  - Users: Unlimited
  - Cost: $0
  - Purpose: Adoption, community, showcase

CLOUD Tier ($100/mo):
  - Target: 1,000 teams
  - Annual: $100K × 12 = $1.2M/year
  - Converts: 10% of free users

SHELL Tier ($1,000/mo):
  - Target: 100 enterprises
  - Annual: $100K × 12 = $1.2M/year
  - Converts: 1% of cloud users

TOTAL: $2.4M annual recurring revenue (conservative)
```

**Growth Path:**
- Year 1: $2.4M ARR
- Year 2: $6M ARR (2.5x growth)
