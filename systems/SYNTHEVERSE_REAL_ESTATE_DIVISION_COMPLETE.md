## 🔄 NESTED SHELLS ARCHITECTURE

### Infinite Nesting Within Your Property

**The Power of Nesting:**

When you own a Shell, Cloud, or Sandbox, you can create NESTED realities within it:

**Example: You Own a Shell Deed**
```
Your Shell (Vault, 25 capacity)
    ↓
Within it, you create:
    ├─ 5 nested Clouds (exclusive rooms)
    ├─ 20 nested Sandboxes (public areas)
    └─ 1 nested Shell (inner sanctum)
        ↓
        Within that nested Shell:
            ├─ 3 nested Clouds
            └─ 10 nested Sandboxes
                ↓
                Infinite recursion...
```

**Nesting Rules:**
```
Shell can contain:
├─ Unlimited nested Shells
├─ Unlimited nested Clouds
└─ Unlimited nested Sandboxes

Cloud can contain:
├─ Unlimited nested Clouds
└─ Unlimited nested Sandboxes
(Cannot contain Shells - Shell is higher tier)

Sandbox can contain:
└─ Unlimited nested Sandboxes
(Cannot contain Clouds or Shells - they're higher tiers)
```

**Revenue from Nested Properties:**
```
You own a Shell
    ↓
Create 5 nested Clouds within it
    ↓
Rent those Clouds to others
    ↓
Earn SYNTH from their rent
    ↓
They create nested Sandboxes
    ↓
You get % of their revenue too
    ↓
Multi-level property income
```

**NSPFRNP Recursive Nature:**
- Each nest is its own reality
- Infinite depth possible
- Queen Bee Nodes coordinate all levels
- Full sensory reality at every level
- Time can be different at each level
- Physics can be different at each level
- Themes can be different at each level
