## 🔄 HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER

```yaml
BLOCKCHAIN (Infrastructure):
└─ Validators run nodes on NSPFRNP blockchain
   └─ Secure the network through Queen Bee consensus
      └─ Process transactions (property transfers, payments, etc.)
         └─ Earn rewards (block rewards + transaction fees)
            └─ Maintain decentralized coordination layer

VIBEVERSE (Application):
└─ Property owners use NSPFRNP blockchain
   └─ Ownership recorded on-chain (deeds, transfers)
      └─ Transactions processed by validators
         └─ Coordination enabled by Queen Bee nodes
            └─ SYNTH flows through both ecosystems

SYNERGY:
├─ Validators secure network → Enable property ownership
├─ Property owners generate transactions → Pay validator fees
├─ More property activity → Higher validator rewards
├─ More validators → More security → Higher property values
└─ Network effects: Both sides grow together
```
