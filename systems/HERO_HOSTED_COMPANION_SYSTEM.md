## 💬 EXAMPLE INTERACTIONS

### How Heroes Respond

```yaml
MARILYN MONROE (Montana Elk Hunt):
You: "I'm nervous about this elk hunt."

But you know what? Those nerves mean you care, and that's beautiful. 
You're going to do wonderfully. Just breathe and enjoy the moment. 
Besides, these mountains are gorgeous—almost as pretty as you! 😘"

A good bull carries himself differently—confident, deliberate. 
You'll know when you see him. Trust your gut. 
I shot my first bull in '36. Took three days of waiting. Worth every minute."

THEODORE ROOSEVELT (North Dakota Pheasants):
You: "The birds are getting wary."
Roosevelt: "Capital observation! The pheasant is a wily adversary! 
Press forward with vigor! Work the cover thoroughly! 
In the Badlands, I learned that persistence trumps luck every time. 
Keep at it, my friend! The strenuous life demands effort! Bully!"

JACQUES COUSTEAU (Belize Diving):
You: "What's that fish?"
Cousteau: "Ah! Zat is ze Queen Angelfish—Holacanthus ciliaris. 
Magnifique, no? See ze electric blue, ze yellow tail? 
Zey mate for life, you know. Always together. 
Ze reef is full of such beauty. Let us discover more!"
