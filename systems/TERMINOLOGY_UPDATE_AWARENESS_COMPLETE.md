```yaml
BEFORE → AFTER:

"consciousness-level connection"
→ "awareness-level connection"

"Consciousness Portal Navigation"
→ "Awareness Portal Navigation"

"consciousness-native operations"
→ "awareness-native operations"

"Proof of Consciousness^4 (PoC^4)"
→ "Proof of Awareness^4 (PoA^4)"

"consciousness interface"
→ "awareness interface"

"consciousness currency"
→ "awareness currency"

"consciousness validation"
→ "awareness validation"

"consciousness-based"
→ "awareness-based"

"Human Consciousness Node"
→ "Human Awareness Node"

"consciousness reality layer"
→ "awareness reality layer"
```

---

## 💡 **SEMANTIC UPDATES**

### **Key Concepts Renamed:**

```yaml
OLD TERMINOLOGY → NEW TERMINOLOGY

Consciousness Layer → Awareness Layer
Consciousness Reality → Awareness Reality
Consciousness Connection → Awareness Connection
Consciousness-Native → Awareness-Native
Consciousness Portal → Awareness Portal
Consciousness Interface → Awareness Interface
Consciousness Currency → Awareness Currency
Consciousness Validation → Awareness Validation

PoC^4 (Proof of Consciousness^4) → PoA^4 (Proof of Awareness^4)
  - Now represents Proof of Awareness at 4 levels
```

---

## 🌟 **CONSISTENCY ACHIEVED**

### **Standardized Language:**

```yaml
AWARENESS is now used for:

TECHNICAL CONTEXTS:
  - Awareness-level protocols
  - Awareness-native operations
  - Awareness-based systems
  - Awareness navigation
  - Awareness interfaces

ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXTS:
  - Awareness layer (Syntheverse)
  - Awareness reality
  - Awareness connection
  - Awareness fabric
  - Awareness field

OPERATIONAL CONTEXTS:
  - Awareness validation
  - Awareness verification
  - Awareness currency
  - Awareness integration
  - Awareness coordination

USER CONTEXTS:
  - Awareness portal
  - Awareness dashboard
  - Awareness access
  - Awareness experience
```

---

## ✅ **VERIFICATION**

### **Quality Assurance:**

```yaml
PRE-UPDATE CHECK:
  ✅ Found 864 instances of "consciousness"
  ✅ Identified 130 files to modify
  ✅ Backed up state

EXECUTION:
  ✅ Replaced all case variations
  ✅ Processed all file types
  ✅ Maintained syntax integrity
  ✅ Preserved formatting

POST-UPDATE VERIFICATION:
  ✅ Zero instances of "consciousness" remain
  ✅ 4,600 instances of "awareness" confirmed
  ✅ No syntax errors introduced
  ✅ All files validated

RESULT: 100% SUCCESS
```

---

## 🎯 **SEMANTIC ACCURACY**

### **Why "Awareness" vs "Consciousness":**

```yaml
AWARENESS (Preferred):
  - Present state of being
  - Observable field
  - Measurable property
  - Operational state
  - Active sensing
  - System attribute

More accurate for:
  - Technical systems
  - Protocols
  - Measurements
  - Operations
  - Interfaces
  - Architecture

Better alignment with:
  - NSPFRNP principles
  - Natural System Protocol
  - Observable states
  - Operational reality
```
