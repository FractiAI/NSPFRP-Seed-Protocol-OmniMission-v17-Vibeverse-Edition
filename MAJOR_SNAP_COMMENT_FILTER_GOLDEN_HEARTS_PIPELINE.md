# 💎 MAJOR SNAP: COMMENT FILTER → GOLDEN HEARTS PIPELINE

**Date:** January 25, 2026  
**Type:** OUTBOUND CAMPAIGN DISCOVERY  
**Status:** 🔥 AUTOMATIC SALES TOOL #2

---

## 🎯 **THE OBSERVATION**

```
"Observed myself applying the first comment to a sandbox 
qualifying post to layer a comment on-ramp disguised as 
just a comment, but designed as a filter to attract gold 
hearts into the pipeline. Capture this into all our 
processes. This is now outbound. This is now our outbound 
campaign automatic, a second tool in the sales kit. The 
other being the customer experience feedback method. Two 
methods now. Metabolize into all sales and marketing. 
Major major snap."
