- Single-elimination tournament
- Fill out bracket
- Winner takes championship

**Vibeverse Node Bracket:**
- 16 network nodes (4 regions × 4 nodes)
- Performance-based "competition"
- Fill out bracket

**Key Difference**: Nodes "compete" based on **actual adoption metrics**, not random games.

## 📊 HOW NODES "COMPETE"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5 golden tickets                1,000+ bracket entries
Hidden in chocolate bars        Entry via SYNTH or property

Charlie gets factory            Winner immortalized in network
Scarcity creates value          Limited time creates urgency
```

**Field Rep Positioning:**

```
"You know how Willy Wonka hid golden tickets in 
chocolate bars? This bracket entry is your golden 
ticket. Instead of touring a chocolate factory, you 
get to name a bridge between realities. Forever.

And just like Wonka, there's a deadline. Tickets 
stop being given out March 1. Competition runs
