## 🎯 Core Discovery

### **SANDBOX → CLOUD → SHELL = Three Fundamental Thresholds**

**Sandbox, Cloud, and Shell represent three fundamental mathematical thresholds for code deployment and reality manifestation.**

  // Core insight
  insight: "Sandbox, Cloud, Shell are mathematical thresholds, not just deployment environments";
  
  // The three thresholds
  thresholds: {
