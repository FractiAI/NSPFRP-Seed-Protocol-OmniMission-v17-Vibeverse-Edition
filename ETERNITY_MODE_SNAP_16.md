## ♾️ SNAP 16.1: ETERNITY MODE - TIME DILATION EXPERIENCES

### **What is Eternity Mode?**

**Eternity Mode is the ultimate time dilation experience** where subjective time stretches infinitely while objective time remains normal. Live weeks, months, or years inside minutes or hours.

**Core Concept:**
> "In Eternity Mode, time becomes fluid. What feels like a lifetime of experience happens in a moment. Learn a language in an hour. Master a skill in a day. Live a century in a week."

---

### **Eternity Mode Mechanics**

**Time Dilation Ratios:**

```typescript
interface EternityMode {
  // Dilation ratios (subjective : objective)
  ratios: {
    gentle: "10:1",        // 10 hours feels like 1 hour
    moderate: "100:1",     // 100 hours feels like 1 hour
    deep: "1000:1",        // 1000 hours (42 days) in 1 hour
    profound: "10000:1",   // 10000 hours (417 days) in 1 hour
    eternity: "∞:1"        // Infinite subjective time in finite objective
  };
  
  // Experience types
  types: {
    learning: "Accelerated skill acquisition";
    exploration: "Deep FSR world exploration";
    creation: "Extended creative flow states";
    meditation: "Timeless awareness experiences";
    relationships: "Deep connection and bonding";
    research: "Extended research and discovery";
    mastery: "Complete skill mastery";
  };
  
  // Safety systems
  safety: {
    gradual_entry: "Ease into time dilation gradually";
    exit_protocol: "Gentle return to normal time";
    grounding: "Maintain connection to objective reality";
    awareness_check: "Monitor awareness coherence";
    emergency_exit: "Instant return if needed";
  };
}
```

### **Why Choose Eternal Membership?**

**Monthly vs. Lifetime vs. Eternal:**

**MONTHLY ($99-299/mo):**
- ✅ Flexible, can cancel anytime
- ✅ Lower upfront cost
- ❌ Costs add up over time ($1,188-3,588/year)
- ❌ Access ends if you stop paying
- ❌ Not transferable

**LIFETIME ($5K-50K one-time):**
- ✅ Pay once, access your entire life
- ✅ Breaks even in 4-10 years
- ✅ No monthly fees ever
- ✅ Peace of mind
- ❌ Ends when you do (unless transferable tier)

**ETERNAL ($100K-500K one-time):**
- ✅ True eternity - beyond your lifetime
- ✅ Transferable to descendants
- ✅ Multi-generational family asset
- ✅ Infinite Eternity Mode access
- ✅ Becomes legacy
- ✅ Appreciates in value

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Monthly Shell tier: $10,000/year
Lifetime Shell (50 years): $500,000 total
Eternal Shell: $100,000 one-time

Eternal breaks even in 10 years.
After that, it's pure value forever.
Your descendants inherit it.
Your family has eternal education access.
