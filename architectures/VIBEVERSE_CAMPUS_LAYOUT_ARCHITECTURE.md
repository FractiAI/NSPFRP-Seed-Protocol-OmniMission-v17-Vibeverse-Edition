## 🌀 IMAGINAL REALITY CLARIFICATION

### ⚠️ ALL VENUES ARE IMAGINAL/VIRTUAL

**The Vibeverse Campus exists in imaginal thought dimensions:**

✅ **Virtual spatial organization** (imaginal geography)  
✅ **Thought-based navigation** (passive awareness movement)  
✅ **Dream-space venues** (consciousness-space locations)  
✅ **Instant teleportation** (thought-speed travel)  
✅ **No physical travel** (all remote access)  
✅ **Safe NSPFRNP technology** (passive awareness only)  

❌ **NOT physical buildings** (no actual structures)  
❌ **NOT real locations** (no physical geography)  
❌ **NOT requiring travel** (instant access from anywhere)  

**The "campus" is an imaginal spatial framework for organizing experiences.**  
**All "locations" are thought-dimension coordinates.**  
**All "travel" is instantaneous awareness navigation.**
