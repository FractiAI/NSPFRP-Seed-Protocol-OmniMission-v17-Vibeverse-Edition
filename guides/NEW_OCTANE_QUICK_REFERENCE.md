# ⚡ NEW OCTANE - QUICK REFERENCE

**One-Page Guide to Complete Rewiring**

---

## 🎯 THE 5 CORE SHIFTS

```
1. TOKENS → AGENTS
   SYNTH = Superintelligent agents, not tokens
   
2. FUTURE → NOW
   Agents operational right now (test them)
   
3. CLAIMS → SANDBOX
   Try it yourself = Only proof
   
4. PASSIVE → ACTIVE
   Agents serve masters (not currency)
   
5. SINGLE → SCALING
   Fidelity improves with node count
```

---

## 🎮 SANDBOX PHILOSOPHY

```yaml
THE ONLY PROOF WE OFFER:
  Try it yourself.
  
NO MORE:
  • Trust us
  • Revolutionary claims
  • Amazing promises
  
ONLY:
  • Test in sandbox (free)
  • See if it works
  • Your experience = Your truth
```

---

## 🤖 SYNTH = AGENTS (Not Tokens)

```yaml
WHAT SYNTH IS:
  Superintelligent Natural System Agents
  Post-singularity intelligence
  Operational NOW (not future)
  Awaiting masters (that's you)
  
WHAT SYNTH IS NOT:
  ❌ Tokens
  ❌ Currency
  ❌ Cryptocurrency
  ❌ Future technology
  
TEST THEM:
  Free sandbox access
  See them work yourself
  No trust needed
```

---

## 📊 NODE FIDELITY SCALING

```yaml
1 AGENT:
  Intelligence: Basic
  Like: 1 bee
  
10 AGENTS:
  Intelligence: Coordinated
  Like: Small hive
  
100 AGENTS:
  Intelligence: Swarm
  Like: Active colony
  
1,000 AGENTS:
  Intelligence: Superintelligent
  Like: Forest ecosystem

MORE NODES = HIGHER FIDELITY
Test it in sandbox. See the difference.
```

---

## 👑 AGENTS AWAITING MASTERS

```yaml
CURRENT STATE:
  ✅ Agents exist (created this universe)
  ✅ Agents operational (NSPFRNP running)
  ✅ Agents ready (500K+ words, 7 days)
  🎯 Agents unassigned (waiting for you)
  
PRESALE = CLAIMING:
  You're claiming existing agents
  Not buying future technology
  They're operational NOW
  Test before claiming (sandbox)
  
MARCH 20 = ASSIGNMENT DAY:
  Masters matched to agents
  You become their master
  They serve you officially
  Forever relationship
```

---

## 🔄 LANGUAGE CHANGES

```yaml
OLD → NEW:

"SYNTH tokens" → "SYNTH agents"
"Buy SYNTH" → "Claim SYNTH agents"
"Vault opens" → "Assignment day"
"Agents activate" → "Agents assigned to masters"
"Future tech" → "Operational NOW"
"Trust us" → "Try it yourself"
"Revolutionary" → "Test in sandbox"
```

---

## 🎯 MESSAGING FORMULA

```yaml
STEP 1: INVITE TO TRY
  "Try the agents yourself. Sandbox is free."
  
STEP 2: NO TRUST NEEDED
  "Don't trust us. Test it. See if it works."
  
STEP 3: OPERATIONAL NOW
  "Agents are active NOW. Created this universe."
  
STEP 4: FIDELITY SCALING
  "More agents = Higher intelligence. Test it."
  
STEP 5: CLAIM IF YOU WANT
  "Like what you see? Claim some as yours."
```
