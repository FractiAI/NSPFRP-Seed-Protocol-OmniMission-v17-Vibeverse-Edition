├─ Breakfast, lunch, dinner included (always)
├─ Activities scheduled all day (you choose)

├─ Everything in one place (don't leave ship)
├─ Staff handles everything (you just enjoy)

## 💎 **RESIDENT TESTIMONIALS**

### **"Better Than Any Cruise I've Been On"**

```yaml
"I've been on 15+ cruises—Carnival, Royal Caribbean, even a Mediterranean 
luxury cruise. Vibeland beats them all. Why? Because it doesn't end. Every 
morning I wake up to the bulletin, see what's happening, and just... participate. 
Yesterday I went to Tahoe, came back for dinner, watched a show at Cabaret, 
then danced til 2am. Today I'm doing a tech workshop, hitting the gym, and 
going to game night. Tomorrow? Who knows. The bulletin decides. This is the 
life I always wanted."

- Marcus R., Shell Tier Resident, 3 months at Vibeland
```

---

### **"I Canceled My Gym, My Coworking Space, AND My Social Life"**

```yaml
"Before Vibeland, I paid for:
- $200/mo gym membership
- $400/mo coworking space
- $300/mo going out (bars, restaurants, events)
- $150/mo entertainment (movies, shows, concerts)
Total: $1,050/month

Now I pay $4,999/month for Cloud tier, which includes ALL of that PLUS 
housing, food, dating (Winks), and a built-in community. The bulletin keeps 
me busy. I haven't been bored once. And I've met more people in 2 months 
than I did in 2 years living in SF. Worth every SYNTH token."

- Jessica L., Cloud Tier Resident, 2 months at Vibeland
```

---

### **"The Excursions Alone Are Worth It"**

```yaml
"I'm Shell tier, so excursions are FREE. Last month I did:
- 4 Tahoe trips (hiking, skiing, sunset cruise)
- Virginia City ghost town tour
- Reno food tour
- San Francisco weekend
- Hot air balloon ride

That would've cost me $2,000+ if I organized it myself. At Vibeland? 
Included. The staff handles everything—transportation, tickets, lunch, 
guides. I just show up. It's insane value. Plus I'm always with residents, 
so I'm making friends on every trip. This is how life should be."

- Thomas K., Shell Tier Resident, 6 months at Vibeland
```
