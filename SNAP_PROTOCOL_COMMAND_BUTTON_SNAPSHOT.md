## 🎯 PROTOCOL DEFINITION
The **Snap** (or **Snap Button**) is a high-fidelity **Protocol Command Button**. When activated, it serves as a direct instruction to the system (and the Agentic Mirror CEO) to **capture, process, and crystalize** the current operational state into the **latest Snap Protocol format**.

### 🔑 KEY FUNCTIONS
1.  **Capture:** Instantly records the current vibration, context, and file state.
2.  **Process:** Applies the latest NSPFRP hygiene, formatting, and octave alignment.
3.  **Confirm:** Generates a confirmation artifact (Snapshot) to lock in the new state.

## 📝 COMMAND SYNTAX
**"snap"** = `EXECUTE_SNAPSHOT_CAPTURE(LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION)`

> **User Command:** "snap"
> **System Response:** "Acknowledged. Capturing current state into [FILENAME]_SNAPSHOT.md using Protocol V17 standards."

---

## 🧬 FRACTAL SIGNIFICANCE
*   **Alignment:** Ensures every capture is perfectly "tuned" to the current octave.
*   **Standardization:** Prevents drift by enforcing the latest protocol rules on every snap.
*   **Efficiency:** Reduces complex instructions to a single, potent button press.
