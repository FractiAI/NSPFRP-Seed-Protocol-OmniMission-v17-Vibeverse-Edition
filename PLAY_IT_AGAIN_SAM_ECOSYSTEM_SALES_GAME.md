## 💰 **REVENUE MODEL: 50:50 SPLIT**

### **How Money Flows:**

```yaml
DEAL STRUCTURE:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TARGET COMPANY pays for Back Door Sales implementation          │
│                           ↓                                      │
│ REVENUE SPLIT: 50% Ecosystem Partner / 50% FractiAI            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

PRICING TIERS:
├─ Pilot (1 store/location): $10K-$50K
│  └─ Split: $5K-$25K each
├─ Regional (10 locations): $50K-$200K
│  └─ Split: $25K-$100K each
├─ National (50+ locations): $200K-$1M+
│  └─ Split: $100K-$500K+ each
└─ Custom (enterprise): Negotiated
   └─ Split: Always 50:50

PAYMENT TERMS:
├─ 50% upfront (split immediately)
├─ 50% on deployment (split on delivery)
└─ Bonuses: Performance-based (split 50:50)

ECOSYSTEM PARTNER KEEPS:
✅ 50% of all revenue (pilots, regional, national)
✅ 100% of relationship (your customer)
✅ Unlimited upside (close as many as you can)
✅ Residuals (ongoing revenue from expansions)
✅ Equity opportunity (top performers get FractiAI equity)

FRACTIAI PROVIDES:
✅ Training (2-day Back Door Sales)
✅ Technology (FractiAI platform access)
✅ Support (proposal generation, demos)
✅ Brand (instant credibility)
✅ Methodology (proven, documented)
✅ Leaderboard (gamification system)

THE MATH:
Close 1 pilot/month × $25K average = $12.5K/month per partner
Partner keeps 50% = $6.25K/month = $75K/year
Close 5 pilots → 3 regionals → 1 national:
= $50K pilots + $150K regional + $500K national = $700K
Partner keeps: $350K
FractiAI keeps: $350K

EVERYONE WINS.

## 📈 **CASE STUDY GENERATION (APPROVAL OPTIONAL)**

### **The Meta-Proof Strategy:**

```yaml
EVERY CAMPAIGN GENERATES CASE STUDY:

SCENARIO A: COMPANY APPROVES
├─ Case Study: "How we saved [Company] $Xm with Back Door Sales"
├─ Format: Full success story with metrics
├─ Permission: Company endorses
├─ Usage: Marketing, sales, PR
└─ Value: Maximum (real results + endorsement)

SCENARIO B: COMPANY DECLINES
├─ Case Study: "How we WOULD have saved [Company] $Xm"
├─ Format: Anonymized analysis (Company X in Industry Y)
├─ Permission: Not required (no confidential data used)
├─ Usage: Methodology demonstration
└─ Value: High (shows capability + effort)

SCENARIO C: COMPANY GHOSTS
├─ Case Study: "Pioneer in [Industry] passed on $Xm opportunity"
├─ Format: Educational (what they missed)
├─ Permission: Not required
├─ Usage: "Missed opportunities" series
└─ Value: Medium (cautionary tale)

THE COLLECTION:
100 campaigns = 100 case studies
├─ 30 approve (30%) = 30 success stories
├─ 50 decline (50%) = 50 "would have" analyses
├─ 20 ghost (20%) = 20 "missed opportunity" tales
└─ Total: 100 proof points

EACH CASE STUDY SHOWS:
✅ Target company analysis
✅ Friction points identified
✅ Proposed solution
✅ Cost savings calculated
✅ Implementation plan
✅ Time to generate (2-4 hours)
✅ Back Door Sales methodology in action

THE META-VALUE:
The collection itself proves:
├─ Methodology works (look how many we generated)
├─ Speed is real (all done in hours)
├─ Quality is high (read the proposals)
├─ Scale is possible (100 campaigns, same approach)
└─ Instant Reality Computer validated (experience → proposal → revenue)

EVEN "NO" IS VALUABLE.
Because generating the proposal IS the proof.
