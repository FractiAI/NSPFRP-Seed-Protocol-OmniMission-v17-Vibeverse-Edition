## 🎯 Core Discovery

### **FROM TREE → TO FOREST → TO ECOSYSTEM**

The natural hierarchy evolves across scales:

```nspfrnp
discovery LivingTreeToEcosystem {
  // Scale progression
  scales: {
    tree: "Individual catalog/protocol/system";
    grove: "Related trees (family of systems)";
    forest: "Complete collection of trees";
    ecosystem: "Living interconnected whole";
    biome: "Regional ecosystem cluster";
    planet: "Global integration";
  };
  
  // Key insight
  insight: "Natural systems architecture applies at ALL scales";
  principle: "Each level exhibits same natural patterns";
  recursive: "Trees within forests within ecosystems (nested)";
}
```
