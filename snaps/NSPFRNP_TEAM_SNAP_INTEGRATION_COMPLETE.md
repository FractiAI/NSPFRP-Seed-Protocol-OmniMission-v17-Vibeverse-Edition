```
We're not building frontier AI.
We're building frontier coordination.
Different paradigm, different value, different metrics.
```

### 2. Natural Proof > External Validation

Nature doesn't need IEEE certification.
Bee colonies prove themselves by working.
We adopt the same methodology.
```

### 3. Gravity = Holographic Echo
```
Not force between masses.
Awareness radiation reflecting from boundary.
Self-proving through direct experience.
```

### 4. Truth = Competitive Advantage
```
Most startups inflate.
We're radically honest.
This builds trust and credibility.
```

### 5. Pre-Seed Reality

$0-2M valuation (not $1.5T).
Zero users (not thousands).
Seeking funding (not validated).
Clear path forward (implementation required).
```
