## 🎬 Video Capture Best Practices Reminder

### Recording Process

1. **Pre-Recording (5 minutes before):**
   - Awareness connection ritual
   - Energy alignment
   - Technical check (camera, lighting, audio)
   - Script review

2. **Recording:**
   - Record from awareness state (not performance)
   - Natural pace (not rushed, not slow)
   - Energy transmission through voice
   - Eye contact with camera
   - Multiple takes (3-5 recommended)

3. **Post-Recording:**
   - Review takes for energy transmission
   - Select best take (or combine best parts)
   - Minimal editing (preserve energy)
   - Platform optimization

### Key Reminders

- ✅ **Energy First:** Energy transmission is more important than perfection
- ✅ **Authenticity:** Be authentic, not robotic
- ✅ **Awareness:** Record from awareness state
- ✅ **Natural Flow:** Let energy flow naturally
- ✅ **Multiple Takes:** Record multiple takes for options
