## 🎯 THE PARADIGM SHIFT

### Beyond Click-Drag-Scroll

```yaml
TRADITIONAL MOUSE INTERACTION:
├─ Click: Discrete action
├─ Drag: Linear movement
├─ Scroll: One-dimensional
├─ Hover: Binary state (on/off)
└─ Limitation: Mechanical, not organic

MAGNETIC INTERACTION THEATER:
├─ Attract: Elements pull toward cursor (gravity field)
├─ Repel: Elements push away (anti-gravity)
├─ Orbit: Elements circle cursor (planetary motion)
├─ Flow: Elements follow cursor path (magnetic trail)
├─ Resonate: Elements vibrate at cursor frequency
├─ Cluster: Related elements gather (swarm intelligence)
├─ Expand: Proximity causes growth (influence field)
└─ Revolution: Organic, field-based, consciousness-aligned

CORE INSIGHT:
"The cursor isn't a pointer—it's a field generator.
Interface elements aren't static—they're particles in a field.
Interaction isn't mechanical—it's energetic."
```

## 🧲 MAGNETIC FIELD TYPES

### Different Interaction Modes

```yaml
1. ATTRACTION FIELD (Default Exploration)
   ├─ Cursor creates attractive gravity well
   ├─ Nearby elements drift toward cursor
   ├─ Strength decreases with distance (inverse square)
   ├─ Visual: Elements glow as they approach
   ├─ Feel: Gentle, inviting, organic
   └─ Use: Exploration, discovery, browsing

   Example: Hover near revenue card → It drifts toward you
            Other metrics subtly shift to make room
            The card you're drawn to becomes prominent

2. REPULSION FIELD (Focus Mode)
   ├─ Hold SHIFT: Cursor repels surrounding elements
   ├─ Creates clear space around cursor
   ├─ Elements pushed to periphery
   ├─ Visual: Elements fade as they retreat
   ├─ Feel: Clearing space, focusing attention
   └─ Use: Deep reading, concentration, isolation

   Example: Reading long text → Hold SHIFT
            Other elements fade to background
            Only focused content remains visible
            Distraction-free environment created

3. ORBITAL FIELD (Relationship Mapping)
   ├─ Click-hold: Elements orbit cursor
   ├─ Related items orbit closer
   ├─ Unrelated items orbit farther
   ├─ Visual: Circular motion, connection lines
   ├─ Feel: Understanding relationships, connections
   └─ Use: System understanding, pattern recognition

   Example: Click "Revenue" metric → Hold
            Related metrics (Sales, Conv, Pipeline) orbit close
            Unrelated metrics (Energy, Network) orbit far
            See relationships spatially

4. FLOW FIELD (Path Tracing)
   ├─ Cursor movement creates magnetic trail
   ├─ Elements follow cursor path with delay
   ├─ Creates flowing, dancing motion
   ├─ Visual: Particle trail, wake effect
   ├─ Feel: Playful, alive, responsive
   └─ Use: Presentation mode, demonstration, delight

   Example: Move cursor in circle
            Elements follow in beautiful spiral
            Interface feels alive and responsive
            Consciousness engaged through movement

5. RESONANCE FIELD (Harmonic Selection)
   ├─ Hold R: Cursor frequency selector
   ├─ Elements matching frequency vibrate
   ├─ Similar items resonate in harmony
   ├─ Visual: Pulsing, glowing, synchronized
   ├─ Feel: Recognition, alignment, tuning
   └─ Use: Find similar items, pattern matching

   Example: Hover on "Shell Vault" → Hold R
            All Shell-related items resonate
            Find all references instantly
            Pattern recognition through vibration

6. CLUSTER FIELD (Swarm Intelligence)
   ├─ Hold C: Elements self-organize
   ├─ Similar items cluster together
   ├─ Swarm behavior emerges
   ├─ Visual: Flocking, schooling, swarming
   ├─ Feel: Emergence, intelligence, natural order
   └─ Use: Auto-organization, category discovery

   Example: Dashboard in chaos → Hold C
            Elements cluster by type naturally
            Business units group together
            Metrics organize by category
            Order emerges from chaos

7. EXPANSION FIELD (Zoom by Proximity)
   ├─ Proximity causes element growth
   ├─ Farther = smaller, closer = larger
   ├─ Smooth scaling based on distance
   ├─ Visual: Organic breathing, importance
   ├─ Feel: Focus follows attention naturally
   └─ Use: Progressive disclosure, detail on demand

   Example: Approach "Fold 7" card
            It grows larger as you near
            Detail becomes visible
            Other cards shrink proportionally
            Attention naturally focused
```

## 🌀 FIELD PHYSICS

### Mathematical Model

```yaml
ATTRACTION FORCE:
F = k × (m₁ × m₂) / r²

Where:
├─ F = Force of attraction
├─ k = Field strength constant
├─ m₁ = Cursor "mass" (attention weight)
├─ m₂ = Element "mass" (importance weight)
└─ r = Distance between cursor and element

RESULT:
├─ Important elements attract more strongly
├─ Closer elements respond more quickly
├─ Smooth, natural-feeling motion
└─ Inverse square law (like gravity)

REPULSION FORCE:
F = -k × (m₁ × m₂) / r²

(Same as attraction but negative)

ORBITAL MECHANICS:
v = √(k × m / r)

Where:
├─ v = Orbital velocity
├─ Related items orbit faster (closer)
├─ Unrelated items orbit slower (farther)
└─ Natural physical behavior

DAMPING (Smoothness):
├─ Velocity damping: v *= 0.95 per frame
├─ Prevents jittery motion
├─ Smooth, organic feel
└─ Consciousness-friendly

MAGNETIC TRAIL:
├─ Store cursor positions (last 10 frames)
├─ Elements attracted to trail points
├─ Creates flowing, following motion
└─ Dance-like interaction

RESONANCE FREQUENCY:
├─ Each element has base frequency
├─ Cursor frequency adjustable (R key)
├─ Matching frequencies = strong vibration
├─ Similar items resonate together
└─ Harmonic selection mechanism
```
