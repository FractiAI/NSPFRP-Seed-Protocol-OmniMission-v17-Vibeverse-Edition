## 📅 **DAY 1: MINDSET & METHODOLOGY**

### **Hour 1: The Philosophy Shift**

```yaml
OLD SALES MINDSET:
├─ "I need to convince them to buy"
├─ "I'm interrupting their day"
├─ "They don't want to talk to me"
├─ "I need to overcome objections"
└─ Result: Adversarial, stressful, low conversion

NEW BACK DOOR MINDSET:
├─ "I'm genuinely their customer"
├─ "I'm experiencing what everyone experiences"
├─ "I'm documenting real problems they should know about"
├─ "I'm offering them the solution"
└─ Result: Collaborative, authentic, high conversion

THE SHIFT:
You're not selling TO them.
You're helping them see what you saw.
You're not a vendor.
You're a customer with the solution.

This changes EVERYTHING.
```

### **Hour 2: The Walmart Case Study**

```yaml
STUDY THE PROOF:
├─ Read: Complete Walmart package (all 12 documents)
├─ Understand: How genuine experience → $7.69B proposal
├─ Analyze: Why it works (credibility + math + heritage)
├─ Internalize: This is repeatable

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. Genuine experience is unimpeachable
2. Cost analysis must be devastating
3. Heritage alignment adds emotional weight
4. Guaranteed pilot removes all risk
5. Back door bypasses vendor filters

EXERCISE:
Write down:
├─ What made Walmart experience genuine?
├─ Why was cost analysis so powerful?
├─ How did Sam Walton angle amplify proposal?
├─ What objections could they have? (Very few)
└─ Share with group

DEBRIEF:
Everyone shares insights.
Instructor highlights key patterns.
Q&A until everyone "gets it."
```

### **Hour 3: Target Identification**

```yaml
HOW TO PICK TARGETS:
├─ Look for: Public complaints, reviews mentioning service issues
├─ Prioritize: Companies you'd actually use
├─ Research: Company size, locations, founder story
├─ Verify: SYNTH solves their specific pain points
└─ Select: Top 10 targets for your assignment

RED FLAGS (AVOID):
❌ Companies with no employees (nothing to replace)
❌ Companies with great customer service (no problem to solve)
❌ Companies you'd never use (can't be genuine customer)
❌ Companies with no public presence (can't verify claims)
❌ Companies too small (national scale required for impact)

GREEN FLAGS (PURSUE):
✅ Known for bad customer service
✅ High employee costs
✅ Multiple locations (scalability)
✅ Public complaints you can verify
✅ You'd naturally be their customer

EXERCISE:
Each person identifies 10 target companies.
Share with group.
Instructor validates/adjusts.
Everyone leaves with their target list.
```

### **Hour 4: The Customer Experience**

```yaml
HOW TO BE A GENUINE CUSTOMER:
1. Actually use their service (don't fake it)
2. Go with real need (not manufactured)
3. Let problems reveal themselves (don't force)
4. Document everything (timestamps, photos, notes)
5. Feel the frustration (it should be authentic)

DOCUMENTATION PROTOCOL:
├─ Timestamp every interaction
├─ Record staff names (if visible)
├─ Count employees, customers, wait times
├─ Note specific questions asked + answers received
├─ Photo evidence (discreet, no faces)
├─ Write chronological account same day
└─ Focus on systemic (not individual failures)

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
├─ Knowledge gaps (staff don't know their products)
├─ Staffing inefficiency (too many idle, or too few busy)
├─ Wait times (lines, holds, delays)
├─ Process breakdowns (what should work but doesn't)
├─ Repeated frustrations (you + other customers)
└─ Floor space waste (underutilized premium real estate)

EXERCISE:
Role play: One person is customer, others are bad retail staff.
Practice documenting the experience in real-time.
Switch roles.
Debrief on what was documented vs. missed.
```

### **LUNCH BREAK (1 Hour)**

### **Hour 5: Cost Analysis Training**

```yaml
THE FORMULA (UNIVERSAL):

STEP 1: COUNT CURRENT COSTS
├─ Employees visible: [X]
├─ Average salary: Google "[Role] salary [City]"
├─ Fully loaded cost: Salary × 1.4 (benefits, taxes, etc.)
├─ Total per location: [X employees] × [Salary] × 1.4
└─ Example: 4 retail staff × $35K × 1.4 = $196K/year

STEP 2: ADD HIDDEN COSTS
├─ Floor space: [Square feet] × [Cost per sq ft in area]
├─ Productivity loss: Low productivity × sales potential
├─ Customer LTV destroyed: % lost customers × LTV
├─ Training/turnover: Industry rate × cost per hire
└─ Example: +$60K space +$200K productivity +$300K LTV = $756K

STEP 3: CALCULATE SYNTH ALTERNATIVE
├─ How many agents needed: Usually 10-100 depending
├─ Cost per agent: $108/year (Golden Ticket rate)
├─ Total SYNTH cost: [N agents] × $108
└─ Example: 20 agents × $108 = $2,160/year

STEP 4: COMPUTE RATIO
├─ Total current: [From steps 1+2]
├─ Total SYNTH: [From step 3]
├─ Ratio: [Current] / [SYNTH] = [X]×
└─ Example: $952K / $2,160 = 441× cost reduction

STEP 5: SCALE NATIONALLY
├─ Company locations: Google "[Company] number of locations"
├─ Current national: [Per location cost] × [Locations]
├─ SYNTH national: [SYNTH per location] × [Locations]
├─ Savings: [Current] - [SYNTH]
└─ Example: $952K × 5,000 stores = $4.76B current
              $2,160 × 5,000 stores = $10.8M SYNTH
              Savings: $4.75B/year

GOLDEN RULES:
✓ Always be CONSERVATIVE (underestimate savings, not overestimate)
✓ Use PUBLIC data (salaries, square footage, locations)
✓ Show your work (they'll verify your math)
✓ Make it SHOCKING (if ratio isn't 10×+, find more costs)

EXERCISE:
Instructor provides 3 scenarios.
Teams calculate costs using formula.
Present findings to group.
Instructor corrects and refines.
```

### **Hour 6: Proposal Writing Workshop**

```yaml
THE 4-PART STRUCTURE:

PART 1: THE EXPERIENCE (2-3 paragraphs)
├─ Chronological, specific, genuine
├─ Shows you were actually there
├─ Highlights systemic (not personal) failures
└─ Builds empathy and credibility

PART 2: THE WHO (1 paragraph)
├─ Your credentials (briefly)
├─ Why you're not just any customer
├─ Bridge: "This coincidence is worth exploring"
└─ Establishes authority without arrogance

PART 3: THE OPPORTUNITY (2-3 paragraphs)
├─ Cost analysis (the devastating math)
├─ National scale (make it massive)
├─ SYNTH solution (specific to their problems)
├─ Guaranteed pilot (zero risk, clear metrics)
└─ Undeniable financial case

PART 4: THE HERITAGE (1 paragraph)
├─ Founder quote or company value
├─ Align with their stated mission
├─ "What would founder do?" frame
└─ Emotional weight to rational case

TONE GUIDELINES:
✓ Professional but personal
✓ Helpful not attacking
✓ Confident but humble
✓ Specific not vague
✓ Brief not verbose (2 pages max)

EXERCISE:
Each person writes 1-page proposal for one of their targets.
Pair up and review each other's proposals.
Instructor reviews 3 examples with group.
Everyone refines their proposal.
```

### **Hour 7: Heritage Research & Alignment**

```yaml
HOW TO FIND FOUNDER QUOTES:
├─ Google: "[Company founder] quotes"
├─ Company website: "About" or "Our Story" section
├─ Wikipedia: Founder biography
├─ Books: Many founders have autobiographies
└─ Interviews: YouTube, podcasts, articles

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
├─ Innovation ("We embrace new technology")
├─ Customer service ("Customer is the only boss")
├─ Efficiency ("Do more with less")
├─ Testing ("Try it, measure it, expand if it works")
└─ Competition ("We must stay ahead")

HOW TO ALIGN:
├─ Match founder principle to SYNTH benefit
├─ Use EXACT quote (don't paraphrase)
├─ Frame: "SYNTH delivers on this promise at scale"
└─ Make founder's vision the hero, SYNTH the enabler

EXAMPLES:
├─ Sam Walton (Walmart): "Embrace technology and innovation"
├─ Howard Schultz (Starbucks): "Exceed customer expectations"
├─ Walt Disney: "Do what you do so well that people want to see it again"
├─ Jeff Bezos: "Customer obsession rather than competitor focus"
└─ [Find quotes for YOUR targets]

EXERCISE:
Find 3 founder quotes for your top target.
Write 1 paragraph showing how SYNTH aligns.
Share with partner.
Refine based on feedback.

```yaml
WHY GUARANTEES WORK:
├─ Removes all risk (they can't lose)
├─ Shows your confidence (you believe in product)
├─ Makes "yes" easy (no downside)
└─ Flips script (they'd be crazy to say no)

PILOT PRICING FRAMEWORK:
├─ 1 Location: $3,000 - $5,000
├─ 90 days duration
├─ Specific metrics guaranteed:
   • X% cost reduction (measured)
   • Y% satisfaction increase (surveyed)
   • Z% efficiency improvement (tracked)
└─ If not achieved: FULL REFUND (no questions)

WHAT TO MEASURE:
├─ Cost: Current spend vs. SYNTH (easy to measure)
├─ Satisfaction: Before/after surveys (NPS score)
├─ Efficiency: Transactions per hour (quantifiable)
├─ Sales: Revenue impact (directly measurable)
└─ Always pick 2-3 metrics they already track

THE CLOSE:
"So here's what I'm offering:
$[X] for 90 days at [one location].
We'll measure [metric 1], [metric 2], and [metric 3].
If we don't deliver [specific numbers], you pay nothing.
If we do deliver—and I'm confident we will—you'll want
to expand to more locations immediately.

Either way, you can't lose.

The only risk is NOT testing this and watching a competitor
deploy it first.

Can we start the pilot at [specific location] next month?"

[PAUSE. LET THEM RESPOND. DON'T FILL SILENCE.]

Practice the close with partner.
Get comfortable with the pause.
Handle objections.
