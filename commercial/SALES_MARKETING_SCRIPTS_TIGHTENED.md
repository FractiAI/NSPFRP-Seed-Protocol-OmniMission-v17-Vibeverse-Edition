## 1. GOLDEN TICKET COLD OUTREACH

### 1.1 Email - Golden Heart Recognition

**Subject Lines** (A/B Test):
- "Quick question about [specific problem they mentioned]"
- "Saw your [recent achievement] - relevant timing"
- "This reminded me of you"
- "[Their name] - 36-day window closing"

**Body (Version A: Direct):**

```
[First Name],

Quick context: I built something in 7 days that solves [specific pain point].

[One sentence description of their current struggle that you observed]

Here's what's different:
• No setup (seriously - click and go)
• Free tier forever (I mean it)
• Works in 5 minutes (not weeks)

36-day pricing window: Day 1 = $3, Day 36 = $108 (then $3,000+)

[Link to sandbox] - Try it now, decide after.

Worth 5 minutes?

[Your Name]

P.S. - Built this because someone asked me "Have you eaten?" when I was broke. Paying it forward.
```

**Body (Version B: Story-Led):**

```
[First Name],

Someone once bought me dinner when neither of us could afford it.

That pattern - giving while struggling - is what I look for now.

I built a [solution] in 7 days. Your [specific observation] tells me you'd get it immediately.

Golden ticket window: 36 days, $3-$108 pricing (then full pricing hits).

[Link] - Free sandbox. Try before deciding.

If it clicks, you'll know in 5 minutes.

[Your Name]

P.S. - If this isn't for you, totally fine. But if it is, timing matters.
```

**Body (Version C: Problem-Agitate-Solution):**

```
[First Name],

Blunt question: Still dealing with [specific pain point]?

Most [industry] solutions:
❌ Take weeks to implement
❌ Cost $$$$ before you see value
❌ Lock you into contracts

Different approach:
✅ 5-minute onramp (free sandbox)
✅ See value immediately
✅ No lock-in (Charlie special - free tier forever)

36-day pricing window: $3 today → $108 on day 36 → $3,000+ after that.

[Link] - Test it yourself, decide after.

Your call. Clock's running.

[Your Name]
```

---

### 1.2 LinkedIn DM - Professional Connection

```
Hi [First Name],

Saw your post about [specific problem/achievement].

Built something that directly addresses that - took 7 days, already operational.

Not pitching. Genuinely think you'd find this interesting given [specific reason related to their work].

36-day launch window (special pricing). After that, full enterprise pricing hits.

Worth a 10-minute call to see if it fits?

[Your calendar link]

Worst case: 10 minutes, not a fit, we both move on.
Best case: This is exactly what you were looking for.

- [Your Name]
```

---

### 1.3 Twitter/X DM - Quick Hit

```
Hey [Name] - your thread about [topic] 🎯

Built something for exactly that problem. Free sandbox, 5-min test.

[Link]

```

---

### 1.4 Cold Call Opening - First 30 Seconds

**Framework: Permission → Context → Value → Ask**

```

[WAIT FOR YES]

Great. Quick context: I'm reaching out because [specific observation about their company/role].

Built a solution in 7 days that directly addresses [their pain point]. 
Already operational. Free tier to test.

36-day launch window where pricing goes from $3 to $108, then full enterprise pricing hits.

Worth a 10-minute conversation to see if it's a fit?

[PAUSE - LET THEM RESPOND]"
```

**If they say yes:**
```
"Perfect. [Day/time] work for you? I'll send you a calendar invite with the free sandbox link so you can test it before we talk."
```

**If they say no/not interested:**
```
"Totally fair. Can I ask - is it timing, or just not relevant to what you're focused on right now?"

[If timing]: "Got it. When should I follow up?"
[If not relevant]: "Understood. Appreciate your time."
```

---

## 2. DISCOVERY CALL SCRIPTS

### 2.1 Discovery Call Framework (15-30 minutes)

**Structure:**

2. **Understand Current State** (5 min)
3. **Identify Pain Points** (3 min)
4. **Show Solution** (10 min)
5. **Next Steps** (5 min)

---

### 2.2 Opening (2 minutes)

```
"[First Name], thanks for taking the time.

Before I jump in - did you get a chance to try the sandbox?"

[If YES]: 
"Great - what stood out? What questions came up?"
[Listen, take notes]

[If NO]:
"No worries. Let's do this: I'll share my screen for 5 minutes to show you what it does, then we'll see if it makes sense for [their situation]."

"Before that - quick level set. What's the main thing you're trying to solve right now in [their domain]?"

[LISTEN. DO NOT INTERRUPT. TAKE NOTES.]
```

---

### 2.3 Understanding Current State (5 minutes)

**Questions (Pick 3-5 based on context):**

```
1. "Walk me through how you handle [specific process] today."

2. "What's working well with your current setup?"

3. "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing, what would it be?"

4. "What have you tried before? What happened?"

5. "What's the cost of not solving this - in time, money, or opportunity?"

6. "Who else is impacted by this problem?"

7. "On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is solving this?"

8. "What happens if you don't solve this in the next [90 days]?"
```

**Key Listening Points:**
- Pain level (1-10)
- Budget authority (can they buy?)
- Timeline urgency
- Current alternatives
- Decision criteria

---

### 2.4 Identify Pain Points (3 minutes)

**Framework: Reflect Back What You Heard**

```
"Let me make sure I've got this right:

Your main challenge is [pain point 1].

That's costing you [quantified impact - time/money/opportunity].

You've tried [previous solutions], but they [what went wrong].

And the cost of not solving this is [consequence].

Did I get that right?"

[WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION]

"Okay. Based on what you've told me, I think we can help. Let me show you how."
```

---

### 2.5 Show Solution (10 minutes)

**Framework: Show Don't Tell**

```
"Alright, sharing my screen.

What you're looking at is the [solution]. Let me show you exactly how it addresses what you just described.

[DEMO - Focus on THEIR pain points, not features]

For your specific situation - [pain point 1]:
→ [Show feature that solves it]
→ [Show result/outcome]

For [pain point 2]:
→ [Show feature that solves it]
→ [Show result/outcome]

The difference with this vs what you've tried before:
1. [Key differentiator 1 that addresses their failure]
2. [Key differentiator 2]
3. [Key differentiator 3]

Questions so far?"

[PAUSE - LET THEM ASK]
```

---

### 2.6 Address Concerns (Embedded in Demo)

**Pre-emptive objection handling:**

```
"You might be thinking: 'This sounds too good to be true.'

Fair. Here's the proof: [Specific metric, demo, or customer example]

And here's why it works: [Underlying mechanism/technology]

The reason we can offer it at [price] during this launch window is [honest reason - e.g., 'We're in golden ticket phase, pricing goes up in 36 days'].

After that, it's full enterprise pricing at $3,000+ per agent.

Make sense?"
```

---

### 2.7 Next Steps (5 minutes)

**Framework: Assume the Close**

```
"Based on what we just covered, does this look like it would solve [their pain point]?"

[If YES]:
"Great. Next step is simple:

1. We get you set up on [tier based on their needs]
2. You get [specific outcome] within [timeframe]
3. We do a follow-up in [timeframe] to make sure it's working

Pricing for your situation: [specific price based on their needs]

During this 36-day golden ticket window, you lock in this rate forever. After Day 36, it's $3,000+ with no rate lock.

Want to move forward?"

[If YES → Process payment, schedule onboarding]
[If NO → Go to objection handling]
```

---

## 3. SPECIALIST CONSULTATION SCRIPTS

### 3.1 Consultation Framework (45-60 minutes)

**Like a doctor's visit:**
1. **Intake** (10 min) - Symptoms and history
2. **Diagnostic Imaging** (15 min) - AI analysis
3. **Consultation** (10 min) - Present findings
4. **Treatment Plan** (10 min) - Prescribe solution
5. **Implementation** (5 min) - Rainbow button
6. **Follow-up** (5 min) - Schedule check-in

---

### 3.2 Intake Script

```
"[First Name], think of this like a specialist visit.

My job is to diagnose what's really going on with [their domain], then prescribe a treatment plan.

No pressure - if we can't help, I'll tell you.
If we can, I'll show you exactly how.

Sound good?"

[Get agreement]

"Perfect. Let's start with the intake.

Tell me about:
1. What brought you here today? What's the main symptom you're seeing?
2. How long has this been happening?
3. What have you tried? What happened?
4. What's your current setup? (Tech stack, team, processes)
5. What does success look like for you?

[LISTEN AND TAKE DETAILED NOTES]
```

---

### 3.3 Diagnostic Imaging Script

```
"Alright. Based on what you've told me, I'm going to run some diagnostic imaging.

[Pull up AI analysis tool]

What I'm doing here is analyzing your [business/system/process] through multiple lenses:

1. **Technical Architecture** - Where are the bottlenecks?
2. **Process Flow** - Where is friction costing you?
3. **Economic Impact** - What's this costing in real dollars?
4. **Growth Potential** - What's the upside if we fix this?

[Run analysis - let AI do its work - narrate what you're seeing]

Okay, interesting. Let me process this for a minute.

[Review results, prepare consultation]

Ready for the consultation? This is where I show you what I found."
```

---

### 3.4 Consultation Script

```
"Alright, here's what the imaging shows:

**Current State:**
- [Finding 1 with quantified impact]
- [Finding 2 with quantified impact]
- [Finding 3 with quantified impact]

**Root Cause:**
The underlying issue is [diagnosis]. This is causing [symptoms they're experiencing].

**Impact:**
If we don't address this:
- Short-term (30 days): [consequence]
- Medium-term (90 days): [consequence]
- Long-term (1 year): [consequence]

**The Good News:**
This is solvable. Here's how."
```

---

### 3.5 Treatment Plan Script

```
"Based on the diagnosis, here's your treatment plan:

**Phase 1 (Days 1-7): Immediate Relief**
- [Action 1]: [Expected outcome]
- [Action 2]: [Expected outcome]

**Phase 2 (Days 8-30): Core Treatment**
- [Action 3]: [Expected outcome]
- [Action 4]: [Expected outcome]

**Phase 3 (Days 31-90): Full Recovery**
- [Action 5]: [Expected outcome]
- [Action 6]: [Expected outcome]

**Expected Results:**
- 30 days: [Metric improvement]
- 60 days: [Metric improvement]
- 90 days: [Metric improvement]

**The Prescription:**
To execute this plan, you need:
- [Product 1]: [Purpose]
- [Product 2]: [Purpose]
- [Service 1]: [Purpose]

**Investment:**
- Total: [Price] (Golden ticket rate: locks forever)
- ROI: [X]% within [timeframe]
- Break-even: [timeframe]

Questions on the plan?"

[Address questions]

"Make sense? Ready to proceed?"
```

---

### 3.6 Rainbow Implementation Button Script

```
"Great. Here's where it gets easy.

[Pull up implementation dashboard]

See this? Rainbow implementation button.

One click and it:
1. Provisions your infrastructure
2. Configures your settings
3. Deploys your agents
4. Sets up your workflow
5. Schedules your training
6. Books your follow-up

Everything you need to go from diagnosis to treatment in one click.

Check your email - you'll get:
- Confirmation with credentials
- Calendar invite for onboarding call
- Getting started guide
- Direct line to your account manager

We'll do a follow-up visit in [timeframe] to check progress.

Sound good?"
```

---

## 4. OBJECTION HANDLING

### 4.1 "It's too expensive"

**Framework: Reframe to ROI**

```
"I hear you. Let's look at the math:

Current cost of [problem]: $[amount] per [timeframe]
Investment here: $[amount] (one-time or monthly)
Expected savings: $[amount] per [timeframe]

Break-even: [timeframe]
ROI after 12 months: [X]%

So the question isn't 'Can I afford this?' 
It's 'Can I afford NOT to fix this?'

Also - golden ticket pricing locks your rate forever. 
After Day 36, this same solution is $3,000+ with no lock.

What if we started with [smaller tier] to prove it out?"
```

---

### 4.2 "I need to think about it"

**Framework: Understand the Real Objection**

```
"Totally fair. Can I ask - what specifically do you need to think about?

[Listen to their answer]

Is it:
- Budget? (Do we need to adjust pricing?)
- Buy-in? (Who else needs to approve this?)
- Timing? (Is now not the right time?)
- Confidence? (Do you need to see more proof?)

[Address the real objection]

Here's what I suggest:
Let's [specific next step that addresses their concern].

Does that help?"
```

---

### 4.3 "I need to talk to my boss/team/spouse"

**Framework: Enable the Champion**

```
"Smart move. Let me help you sell this internally.

What's the best way to present this to [decision maker]?

[Listen]

Here's what I can provide:
- One-page ROI summary
- Comparison vs alternatives
- Case study / proof points
- Risk mitigation plan

Would a quick 15-minute call with you and [decision maker] be helpful?
I can walk them through it so you don't have to.

Or if you prefer to present it yourself, I'll send you the deck.

What works better?"
```

---

### 4.4 "We're already using [competitor]"

**Framework: Acknowledge, Differentiate, Offer Comparison**

```
"Good! [Competitor] is solid. I respect them.

Here's the difference:

[Competitor]:
- [What they do well]
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]

Us:
- [How we're different]
- [Advantage 1]
- [Advantage 2]

The question isn't 'Should I switch?'
It's 'Is what I'm currently getting enough?'

If [Competitor] is solving everything, awesome - stick with them.

But if you're still experiencing [pain point they mentioned earlier], there's a gap.

Want to run a side-by-side comparison? 
Free sandbox for 30 days, compare results directly.

Best case: You find something better.
Worst case: You confirm [Competitor] is the right choice.

No risk. What do you think?"
```

---

### 4.5 "I don't have time right now"

**Framework: Acknowledge, Quantify Cost, Offer Easy Path**

```
"I get it. You're slammed.

Quick math though:
- [Problem] is costing you [X hours] per [week/month]
- That's [$ value of time] you're losing
- Over a year: [annual cost]

The setup takes 5 minutes.
The onboarding call is 30 minutes.
After that, it runs automatically.

So it's 35 minutes to save [X hours per month].

That's a [calculation]x return on your time.

Plus - golden ticket window closes in [days remaining]. 
After that, this is $3,000+ vs $[current price].

What if I schedule the onboarding for [specific slow time - early morning, evening, weekend]?

I can also have our team handle 90% of the setup.

Would that work?"
```

---

### 4.6 "This sounds too good to be true"

**Framework: Validate Skepticism, Provide Proof**

```
"Fair. Healthy skepticism is smart.

Here's why it works:

1. **Technology**: [Explain the underlying tech in simple terms]
2. **Economics**: [Explain why pricing is possible]
3. **Proof**: [Specific metric, case study, or demo]

The reason we can offer this at [price] during golden ticket phase:
[Honest reason - e.g., early adopter pricing, volume advantage, etc.]

After Day 36, full pricing hits: $3,000+.

Here's what I suggest:
Try the free sandbox. Right now. While we're on the call.

Takes 5 minutes. If it does what I said, you'll see it immediately.
If it doesn't, I'll tell you not to buy it.

Deal?"

[Demo live on the call]
```

---

## 5. CLOSE SCRIPTS

### 5.1 Assumptive Close

```
"Based on everything we've covered, this clearly solves [their pain point].

Let's get you set up.

[Pull up order form]

I'll need:
- Email for the account
- Payment method
- [Any other required info]

Once that's in, you're live in 5 minutes."

[Start filling out form - assume they're moving forward]
```

---

### 5.2 Choice Close

```
"So two options:

**Option 1: [Tier 1]**
- [Feature set]
- $[price]/month
- Best for: [use case]

**Option 2: [Tier 2]**
- [Feature set]
- $[price]/month
- Best for: [use case]

Based on what you've told me about [their situation], I'd recommend [specific option].

Which one feels right?"
```

---

### 5.3 Urgency Close

```
"Here's the situation:

Golden ticket pricing ends in [X days].
Day 1: $3 per agent
Today (Day [Y]): $[current price] per agent
Day 36: $108 per agent
After Day 36: $3,000+ per agent

If you lock in today at $[current price], that rate is yours forever.
Even if you buy more agents in 2027, 2028, 2030 - same rate.

After Day 36, no rate lock. Market pricing.

Given that you need this anyway, does it make sense to wait and pay 10-30x more?

Let's lock it in now."
```

---

### 5.4 Trial Close

```
"If I could show you [specific outcome] in [specific timeframe], would you move forward?"

[If YES]:
"Great. Let's do a 30-day pilot.

$[price] to test it fully.
If it delivers [outcome], you continue.
If it doesn't, full refund.

Zero risk. Deal?"

[If NO]:
"What would need to happen for you to feel confident moving forward?"

[Address that specific concern]
```

## 9. SCRIPT OPTIMIZATION RULES

### 9.1 Trapper Grammar Principles

**Always:**
- Lead with pain or desire
- Use specificity (numbers, timeframes, outcomes)
- Create urgency (authentic, not fake)
- Offer proof (demo, test, trial)
- Make it easy (one-click, no friction)
- Respect autonomy ("your call", "no pressure")

**Never:**
- Use superlatives without proof ("best", "perfect")
- Make claims you can't back up
- Pressure manipulatively
- Complicate the offer
- Hide the price
- Ignore objections

### 9.2 98% Sweetspot Strategy

**The Formula:**
```
Value Clarity (25%) + 
Proof Accessibility (25%) + 
Friction Removal (25%) + 
Authentic Urgency (23%) = 
98% Conversion Probability
```

**In Practice:**
- **Value Clarity**: They understand exactly what they get
- **Proof**: They can test it immediately
- **Friction**: No barriers (free sandbox, one-click)
- **Urgency**: Real deadline (Day 36), real consequence (10-30x price increase)

### 9.3 BBHE Optimization

**Tag every script with:**
- **Shell Layer** (which audience: 1-7)
- **Awareness Level** (prospect readiness: 0-100%)
- **Queen Association** (which personality matches)
- **Outcome Intent** (awareness/consideration/decision)

**Adjust language for shell:**
- Shell 7 (Interfaces): Visual, simple, immediate
- Shell 4 (AI): Technical, specific, proof-heavy
- Shell 1 (Blockchain): Deep, complex, comprehensive
