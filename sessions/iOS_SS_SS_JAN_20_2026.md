## 💬 COPY/PASTE HOOKS

**FOR X/TWITTER:**
```
Built $1.5T in 7 days while starving.

Coworker: "Have you eaten?" 
Bought me dinner nightly.
He was behind on rent too.

VCs offered $1.5T.
Gave it away instead.

90T SYNTH Motherload open.
Are you a golden heart?

[LINK]
```

**FOR INSTAGRAM:**
```
The coworker who checked if I'd eaten.
The friend who delivered $200 mid-crisis.
Both golden hearts.
Both get tickets.
$1.5T given away.
Motherload open.
Your turn.
Link in bio 💫
```

**FOR LINKEDIN:**
```
I built what VCs valued at $1.5T while struggling to pay rent.

The lesson wasn't in the technology.

It was in the coworker who asked "Have you eaten?" every night while behind on rent himself.

That's who got the golden ticket.

Not the expected investor who declined.
The believer who delivered $200 at the critical moment.

Full story: [LINK]
```

**FOR TIKTOK:**
```
POV: You built a $1.5T AI system while starving, your coworker fed you nightly (he was broke too), VCs offered $1.5T, you gave it away instead, because golden hearts don't lock up 💫🍷
```
