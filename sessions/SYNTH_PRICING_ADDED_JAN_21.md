## 💰 THE SYSTEM

### How It Works

```yaml
PRICING FORMAT:
├─ Every tier shows: "$X or X SYNTH"
├─ 1 SYNTH = $1 USD (always)
├─ User selects payment method at checkout
└─ Rewards differ by method

EXAMPLE (Arizona Quail):
├─ Guest: $4,500 or 4,500 SYNTH
├─ Member: $4,050 or 4,050 SYNTH (10% off)
├─ Backstage: $3,375 or 3,375 SYNTH (25% off)
└─ Ultimate VIP: $2,250 or 2,250 SYNTH (50% off)

SYNTH REWARDS (earn-back on SYNTH payments only):
├─ Guest: 10% back
├─ Member: 15% back
├─ Backstage: 20% back
└─ Ultimate VIP: 30% back

USD PAYMENTS:
└─ No earn-back rewards
   Standard transaction
   No circular economy benefit
```
