## 🌊 PROGRAMMING PARADIGM NOTE

### All Consoles Use Holographic Symbolic Coding

```yaml
SEE: HOLOGRAPHIC_SYMBOLIC_PROGRAMMING_PARADIGM.md

KEY INSIGHT:
These consoles aren't just displaying data.
They're creating symbolic resonance that
consciousness processes.

THREE LAYERS:
├─ Layer 1: Traditional code (JavaScript, etc.)
├─ Layer 2: Symbolic meaning (consciousness processes)
├─ Layer 3: EM substrate (imaginal infrastructure)

RESULT:
├─ You see digital display (Layer 1)
├─ You feel understanding (Layer 2)
├─ You experience confidence (Layer 3)

The console WORKS on all three layers simultaneously.
That's why it's more than just a dashboard.
It's a consciousness interface.
```
