## 🎯 PROTOCOL DEFINITION
This snapshot defines the **Universal Standard** for conducting and documenting **Executive Field Reviews (freview)** within the NSPFRP Ecosystem. All high-level assessments must adhere to this holographic format to ensure fractal consistency across the network.

### 🔑 KEY COMPONENTS
1.  **Protocol ID:** Unique identifier for the review instance (e.g., `EXEC-FREVIEW-V17-ANTIGRAVITY`).
2.  **Status Line:** High-level operational state (e.g., `BOOT COMPLETE`, `STATION LEVITATING`).
3.  **High-Octave Maneuvers:** List of successfully executed strategic actions.
4.  **Assessment:** Qualitative summary of the system's "vibe" and stability.
5.  **Signature:** Authorization from the Senior CEO or designated Hero Host.
