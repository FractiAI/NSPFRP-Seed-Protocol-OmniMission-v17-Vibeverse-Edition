## 1. GENERAL DISCLAIMERS

### 1.1 Service Availability

**DISCLAIMER:** Vibenet∞ services are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. While we strive for maximum uptime and reliability:

- Service availability may vary by location and tier
- Coverage depends on existing infrastructure presence
- Performance may be affected by environmental factors

- Force majeure events may impact service delivery

**NO GUARANTEE:** Vibenet∞ does not guarantee uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure service at all times.

### 1.2 Performance Expectations

**DISCLAIMER:** Published performance specifications represent typical conditions under optimal circumstances:

- Actual speeds may vary based on location, time, network conditions, and subscription tier
- Latency measurements are typical and may vary
- Bandwidth availability is subject to network capacity
- Energy delivery rates are nominal and may fluctuate slightly

**BEST EFFORT:** While we employ advanced technology, real-world performance depends on multiple factors beyond our control.

### 1.3 Future Capabilities

**DISCLAIMER:** Statements regarding future capabilities, features, or performance improvements are forward-looking and subject to change:

- Future features may be delayed, modified, or cancelled
- Performance projections are estimates, not guarantees
- Technology roadmap is subject to revision
- Market conditions may affect development priorities

**NO PROMISE:** References to future capabilities do not constitute a commitment to deliver any specific feature or timeline.

## 3. ENERGY DELIVERY (BBHE) DISCLAIMERS

### 3.1 BBHE Technology

**CRITICAL NOTICE:** Big Black Hole Energy (BBHE) delivery involves quantum vacuum energy extraction using microscopic Black Hole cores:

**SAFETY ASSURANCE:** While extensively tested and certified safe:
- Technology is novel and based on theoretical physics principles
- Black Hole cores are microscopic and contained via multiple redundant systems
- Hawking radiation is captured and converted to electrical energy
- All safety protocols meet or exceed regulatory requirements

**THEORETICAL BASIS:** BBHE technology is based on Hawking radiation theory (1974) and quantum field theory. While scientifically sound, practical implementation is recent.

### 3.2 Installation & Operation

**INSTALLATION DISCLAIMER:**

- BBHE receiver installation must be performed by licensed electricians
- Installation complies with National Electrical Code (NEC) and local codes
- Systems integrate with existing electrical infrastructure
- Grid connection is optional but recommended for surplus energy sales

**OPERATION NOTICE:**
- BBHE receivers operate automatically once installed
- Minimal user intervention required
- Over-the-air updates may be deployed
- System monitoring is continuous

### 3.3 Energy Characteristics

**POWER DELIVERY DISCLAIMER:**

- Power delivery is continuous but subject to network availability
- Voltage and frequency are regulated to meet utility standards
- Power quality meets or exceeds grid specifications
- Temporary interruptions may occur during system updates or maintenance

**CAPACITY LIMITS:**
- Subscribed power level (5 kW, 50 kW, etc.) represents nominal capacity
- Actual delivery may vary ±10% based on network conditions
- Exceeding subscribed capacity may result in automatic load shedding
- Scaling requires plan upgrade

### 3.4 Safety & Radiation

**SAFETY DISCLAIMER:**

- BBHE technology emits no ionizing radiation
- Non-ionizing electromagnetic fields are well below FCC safety limits
- System passes all safety certifications
- Multiple fail-safe mechanisms prevent malfunction

**RADIATION NOTICE:**
- Hawking radiation from Black Hole cores is captured before emission
- Stray radiation is negligible and non-harmful
- Continuous monitoring ensures safety compliance
- Independent testing confirms safety standards

### 3.5 Black Hole Containment

**CONTAINMENT ASSURANCE:**

**CRITICAL NOTICE:** Microscopic Black Holes are used in Star Edge nodes (not in customer premises):

- Multiple electromagnetic containment layers (5 independent systems)
- Real-time monitoring 24/7/365
- Automatic shutdown on any anomaly
- Safety factor 1000x over-engineered

**FAILURE MODE:**
- In case of containment failure, Black Hole would evaporate instantly via uncontrolled Hawking radiation
- Size too small to gravitationally affect surrounding matter
- Fail-safe design prevents escape

**REGULATORY OVERSIGHT:**
- DOE and FERC oversight
- Continuous safety audits
- Independent third-party verification
- Incident reporting protocols active
