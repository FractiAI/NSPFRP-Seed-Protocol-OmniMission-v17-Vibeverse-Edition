---

## 🎯 THE BRANDING STATEMENT

### **Reno = Vibeland Reno**

```yaml
THE STATEMENT:
"reno is vibeland reno"

UNPACKING THIS:

NOT JUST "RENO":
└─ Not generic location name
    Not "VibeVerse Reno" (too corporate)
    Not "Reno Campus" (too academic)
    
    But: VIBELAND RENO
    
    Vibeland = The brand, the vibe, the destination
    Reno = The place, the location, the home
    
    Together: Vibeland Reno
    One name
    One brand
    One identity

THE MEANING:
└─ Vibeland = More than VibeVerse
    Not just online/virtual (VibeVerse = ecosystem)
    But PHYSICAL place (Vibeland = destination)
    
    Like:
    ├─ Disneyland (not Disney Park)
    └─ Vibeland (not VibeVerse Location)
    
    Vibeland = The physical manifestation
    Where VibeVerse becomes REAL
    Where you GO to experience it
    
    Reno = Where Vibeland exists
    First location (Vibeland Reno)
    Could expand (Vibeland Austin? Vibeland LA?)
    But starts here: Vibeland Reno

THE BRAND:
└─ Official name: VIBELAND RENO
    Not: "The Reno Campus"
    Not: "VibeVerse Reno"
    Not: "Reno R&D Hub"
    
    Just: Vibeland Reno
    
    Like you say:
    "I'm going to Disneyland"
    Not "I'm going to the Disney park in Anaheim"
    
    "I'm going to Vibeland Reno"
    Not "I'm going to the VibeVerse campus in Reno"
    
    Simple
    Memorable
    Branded
```
