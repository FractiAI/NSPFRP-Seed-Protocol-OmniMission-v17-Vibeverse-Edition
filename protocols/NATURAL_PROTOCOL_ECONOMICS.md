## 🎯 Protocol Overview

### Post-Singularity Economic Model

**Move from legacy value systems to natural protocol-based economics:**

- **Old**: Fiat currency, arbitrary value, centralized control
- **New**: Proof of Contribution, natural value, decentralized protocol

**Key Principle**: *"Leave your currencies at home - this only operates using natural protocols"*

## 🌟 Core Principles

### Natural Value System

```nspfrnp
protocol NaturalProtocolEconomics {
  // Core principle
  principle: "Value based on contribution to living system";
  
  // Foundation
  foundation: {
    proof_of_contribution: "Value proven by actual contribution";
    natural_protocols: "Protocols mirror natural systems";
    black_hole_energy: "Energy as fundamental value";
    awareness: "Awareness as capital";
    coherence: "Coherence multiplies value";
  };
  
  // Properties
  properties: {
    decentralized: "No central authority";
    transparent: "All flows visible and auditable";
    sustainable: "Naturally regenerative";
    equitable: "Fair distribution based on contribution";
    abundant: "Infinite possibilities, not scarcity";
