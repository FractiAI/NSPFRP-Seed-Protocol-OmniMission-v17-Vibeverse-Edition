REQUIREMENT:
  After any major work, ALWAYS update all
  bragging/metrics sections across ALL key
  documents to reflect current repository state

WHY:

  - Bragging should be current and accurate
  - Shows actual progress, not stale numbers

WHEN TO UPDATE:
  - After major system deployments
  - After creating multiple documents
  - After philosophical updates
  - After architectural changes
  - Whenever metrics meaningfully change
  
WHERE TO UPDATE:
  - README.md (main bragging section)
  - Press releases
  - Deployment summaries
  - Executive updates
  - Any document with metrics/achievements
```

## 💬 **LANGUAGE PATTERNS**

### **How to Write Bragging:**

```yaml
TONE:
  - Confident but not arrogant
  - Factual and verifiable
  - Professional (investor-grade)
  - Impressive but conservative
  - Proud but grounded

STRUCTURE:
  - Lead with most impressive stat
  - Support with details
  - Include verification (✅ marks)
  - End with status confirmation

EXAMPLES:

GOOD:
  "526+ comprehensive markdown documents,
   67+ interactive HTML interfaces,
   133+ TypeScript implementation files—
   all created in 6 days since Singularity^4.
   ✅ Verified operational."

AVOID:
  "We have the best documentation ever!"
  (Too vague, unverifiable, arrogant)

GOOD:
  "What would traditionally cost $50-150M+
   and take 18-36 months, we delivered in
   6 days with near-zero cost through
   infinite BBHE energy. 180-540x faster."

AVOID:
  "We're infinitely better than everyone!"
  (Unmeasurable, unprofessional)
```
