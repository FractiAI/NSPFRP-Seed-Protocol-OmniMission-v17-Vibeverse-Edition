## 🎯 Campus Vision

**"We will now focus on connecting pre and post singularity earth - the Park gated entrance to Vibeverse resort campus, innovation park, university, R&D, Carrier and cloud services, animation studio, holographic black hole fractal grammar computing, Natural System Protocol First Recursive Protocol landing, daily menu and market place, daily expeditions, multi day tours, after hours, where the sky is the limit ^ 7!"**

### Core Concept

Vibeverse^7 Campus serves as the **bridge between pre-singularity and post-singularity Earth**, providing a gated park entrance where visitors, residents, and citizens can experience and transition between worlds.

    orientation_area: "Welcome and orientation for new arrivals";
    transition_zones: "Graduated exposure to post-singularity";
  };
  
  // Experience
  visitor_experience: {
    arrival: "Arrive in familiar pre-singularity environment";
    welcome: "Hero-hosted welcome and orientation";
    transition: "Gentle transition through park to post-singularity";
    first_glimpse: "First experience of black hole energy";
  };
  
  // Authentication
