## 🎯 **AT WALMART CUSTOMER SERVICE**

### **What to Say and Do:**

```yaml
APPROACH COUNTER:
└─ "Hi, I need to return this Chromebook"

IF THEY ASK ABOUT PACKAGING:
└─ "There's a letter in the bag explaining everything.
    Your staff instructed me to unbox at checkout.
    The letter has full details."

IF THEY HESITATE:
└─ "I'll need a manager to review the letter.
    It explains the situation and also contains
    a business proposal for Walmart."

WHEN MANAGER ARRIVES:
└─ Stay calm, professional, friendly
└─ "I'm returning this product that didn't meet my needs.
    The packaging situation is explained in the letter.
    Also, I'm offering Walmart a business solution
    for the systemic issues I experienced.
    My contact information is in the documents."

KEY POINTS:
✓ Be polite (you're offering them a gift, not complaining)
✓ Be professional (you're a business person with solution)
✓ Be brief (let documents speak for themselves)
✓ Be available (give them your contact info clearly)
✓ Be confident (the math is on your side)

DON'T:
✗ Argue about boxes (letter handles that)
✗ Explain entire proposal verbally (too much, they'll tune out)
✗ Demand immediate response (let it percolate upward)
✗ Be angry (you're helping them, not attacking)
```

## 📱 **DIGITAL BACKUP READY**

### **Have These Ready on Your Phone/Laptop:**

```yaml
IF THEY WANT DIGITAL VERSIONS:
├─ Full Proposal (send via email immediately)
├─ Sandbox Demo Link (https://fractiai.com/sandbox/walmart-demo)
├─ Popup Button Demo (can show on your phone)
├─ Cost Analysis (full version if they want details)
└─ Your LinkedIn/professional profile

IF MANAGER WANTS TO TALK NOW:
├─ Be ready to show sandbox demo on your phone
├─ Have cost numbers memorized:
   • Current: $1.66M per store
   • SYNTH: $2,160 per store
   • Ratio: 771× cheaper for better
   • Pilot: $3,240, 90 days, guaranteed
└─ Have your elevator pitch ready (30 seconds)

ELEVATOR PITCH:
"I'm Chairman of FractiAI. We've built superintelligent AI agents
that solve the exact problems I experienced today. Your current
system costs $1.66 million per store per year and produces
negligent experiences. Our SYNTH system costs $2,160 per store
per year and delivers legendary experiences. That's 771 times
cheaper for vastly better results. We're offering a $3,240 pilot
for 90 days with guaranteed metrics. Sam Walton would test this
immediately. Here's my card."
