## 📋 **CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE DOCUMENTATION**

### **What I Came to RTC For:**

```
MISSION: Experience first sideline bus ride in downtown Reno
URGENCY: Medium (exploring transportation options)
EXPECTATION: Simple payment, easy boarding, seamless experience
GOAL: Free experience (ideal public transit)
EXPERTISE: Technical (AI systems architect, can evaluate systems)
```

---

### **What Actually Happened (Chronological):**

**INCIDENT 1: Payment Method Confusion**
```
ISSUE: Bus doesn't accept credit cards
DETAIL: Only cash or scan code accepted
IMPACT: Immediate friction - had to use alternative method
OBSERVATION: Most people expect credit card payment in 2026
```

**INCIDENT 2: Scan Code Complexity**
```
ATTEMPT: Tried to use scan code payment
PROBLEM: Multi-step process unclear
DRIVER: "I don't know. Oh no, you have to hit this and then you have to select token and then..."
RESULT: Multiple failed attempts
IMPACT: Confusion, frustration, time wasted
OBSERVATION: Process too complex for quick boarding
```

**INCIDENT 3: Apple Pay Password Reset Loop**
```
PROBLEM: Too many failed scan code attempts
RESULT: Apple requires re-sign in
ISSUE: Need to confirm all passwords
PROBLEM: "I don't have those passwords cause I used it"
HISTORY: This problem happened 4 times already
IMPACT: Can't access account, can't complete payment
OBSERVATION: System creates account lockout loops
```

**INCIDENT 4: Ticket Purchase Location Confusion**
```
INITIAL: Didn't have to buy ticket initially
LATER: Had to come back to buy ticket
CONFUSION: Where to purchase unclear
DD'S HELP: "Over there at the terminal, I think they accept credit card"
TERMINAL: Each door was something else, not for public
SEARCH: Didn't find a window
RESULT: By the time came back, ticket was up
IMPACT: Time wasted, confusion, missed opportunity
```

**INCIDENT 5: Terminal Building Confusion**
```
ISSUE: Terminal building unclear
DETAIL: Each door was something else, not for public
PROBLEM: No clear public access point
SEARCH: Looked for payment window, couldn't find it
RESULT: Had to return to bus location
OBSERVATION: Terminal should have clear public access
```

**INCIDENT 6: Workaround Required**
```
SOLUTION: "I'm going to Walmart and get the cash"
REASON: Need cash to pay for bus
IMPACT: Extra trip, extra time, not ideal
OBSERVATION: Shouldn't need workarounds for basic payment
```

---

### **The Real Problem (Systemic):**

```yaml
SURFACE PROBLEM:
└─ One customer had payment friction on first bus ride

ACTUAL PROBLEM:
└─ Payment Methods: Limited (no credit cards on bus)
└─ Scan Code System: Too complex, unclear instructions
└─ Mobile Payment: Creates account lockout loops
└─ Ticket Purchase: Location unclear, terminal confusing
└─ User Experience: Friction at every step
└─ Accessibility: Terminal not clearly marked for public

RTC'S PERCEPTION:
└─ "Payment systems work, customers figure it out"

CUSTOMER'S PERCEPTION:
└─ "This experience has friction at every touchpoint"
└─ "I want the experience to be free and seamless"
└─ "Public transit should be easier than this"
```

---

### **Why This Matters Beyond One Ride:**

```
CUSTOMER ADOPTION IMPACT:
├─ First-time rider experience sets tone
├─ Payment friction = barrier to adoption
├─ Complex systems = fewer repeat riders
├─ Confusion = negative word of mouth
└─ Each bad experience = Lost ridership + Lost referrals

MULTIPLIER EFFECT:
├─ This experience represents THOUSANDS of similar experiences daily
├─ Each friction point = Lost potential riders
├─ Payment issues = Reduced accessibility
├─ Terminal confusion = Reduced usability
└─ RTC's brand: "Public service" but also "Friction-filled"

COMPETITIVE VULNERABILITY:
├─ Ride-sharing: Seamless payment, one-tap experience
├─ Private transit: Better user experience
├─ Future mobility: Autonomous vehicles with seamless payment
└─ RTC: Competing on public service, losing on experience
```
