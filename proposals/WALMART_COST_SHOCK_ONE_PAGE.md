## 🎯 **SAM WALTON'S MESSAGE THROUGH ME**

```
"You're wasting $7.4 BILLION annually in electronics alone,
paying employees to stand around and chat,
producing experiences so bad customers write formal complaints.

The solution costs $9.97 MILLION annually
and delivers legendary service 24/7.

That's 746× cheaper for vastly better results.

ROLL THIS OUT FIRST.

This is my challenge to you through this customer.
I didn't build Walmart to waste money on inefficiency.

Test it TODAY at Store #1 Rogers.
$3,240 for 90 days.
Prove it works (it will).
Roll it out NATIONALLY.

The math is undeniable.
The experience improvement is guaranteed.
The competitive advantage is insurmountable.

What are you waiting for?"
